### Minor Changes

- feat: @vocoder/core shared primitives, full test coverage, extractor restructure
  - New `@vocoder/core` package: hash, ICU formatting, cookie utilities, shared types
  - Moved hash, ICU, and cookie utilities from `@vocoder/react` into `@vocoder/core`
  - `VocoderTranslationData` now canonical in core; re-exported from config and plugin
  - Full unit test coverage across all packages (529 tests total)
  - Extractor internals split into shared/icu-builders, shared/roles, shared/transform, parse/react
  - New READMEs for core, config, extractor; updated react and root READMEs
